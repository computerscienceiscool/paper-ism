# A Decentralized Infinite State Machine and Promise-Based State Transition System Compatible with Semantic Spacetime and Promise Theory

## Abstract

This paper introduces the concept of a decentralized infinite state machine (ISM) in which each agent manages its local state and interacts with other agents by making promises about future state transitions. We postulate that this ISM framework is compatible with both Semantic Spacetime (SST) and Promise Theory (PT), providing a natural model for distributed systems where the interaction between autonomous agents defines system behavior. Additionally, we propose a generic language for describing state transitions in ISM that aligns with SST and PT principles. This language relies on the concept of promises, where the ISM kernel (the agent) signs tuples that define guaranteed transitions between functions without those functions making promises themselves. We argue that this model maintains the separation of concerns between the kernel and the function execution, consistent with Promise Theory.

## Introduction

Distributed systems face challenges in managing state and coordinating behavior across multiple autonomous agents. A decentralized infinite state machine (ISM) framework offers a solution where each agent independently manages its local state and interacts with others through promises. These promises form a graph of state transitions, creating a decentralized model of computation.

Semantic Spacetime (SST), as introduced by Mark Burgess, offers a way to understand distributed systems as interacting agents that operate based on local knowledge and autonomy, while Promise Theory (PT) provides a formalism for describing the commitments agents make to each other in a distributed environment. We hypothesize that ISM, SST, and PT are compatible, allowing us to develop a cohesive framework for decentralized computation.

This paper explores the relationship between ISM, SST, and PT and introduces a generic language for describing state transitions in a way that aligns with these theories.

## Decentralized Infinite State Machine (ISM)

An *infinite state machine* describes a system where the number of potential states is unbounded. Each agent within the system maintains its local state and interacts with other agents by making promises about future transitions in a state graph. 

In an ISM, each agent is responsible for deciding its own next state based on both internal conditions and the promises made by other agents. These agents are autonomous, following the core principle of Promise Theory, where each agent manages its own behavior and is not dictated by any central authority. Agents only promise *what they will do next*, and these promises can be observed by others to inform their own state transitions.

The *decentralized* aspect of ISM ensures that there is no central controller, and each agent acts independently, promoting scalability and fault tolerance. 

## Semantic Spacetime and ISM Compatibility

Semantic Spacetime (SST) offers a conceptual framework for understanding distributed systems as a set of agents that operate autonomously in both space and time. Agents in SST interact with their environment and each other based on local information and promises. Time and space are fundamental aspects of how agents coordinate and change state.

In the context of ISM, SST can be seen as the backdrop against which agents make promises about state transitions. Each state transition occurs within the spacetime context, and the "next state" in the ISM corresponds to a new configuration of the agent's spacetime environment.

By making promises about the future (the next function to be executed and its expected outputs), agents in an ISM align with the SST principle that system behavior is the emergent result of local interactions in spacetime.

## A Generic Language for State Transitions

To enable ISM compatibility with Promise Theory and Semantic Spacetime, we propose a generic language for describing state transitions. This language uses a tuple format to capture promises about function execution. The proposed format is as follows:

```
(f1, in, inerr, out, outerr, rc, f2)
```

Where:  
- **f1**: The function currently being executed.  
- **in**: Input to the function.  
- **inerr**: Any input error that the function needs to handle.  
- **out**: The expected output of the function.  
- **outerr**: Any output errors generated by the function.  
- **rc**: Return code indicating the result of the function (e.g., success or failure).  
- **f2**: The next function that will be executed in the state graph.

This tuple asserts (or promises) that "function f1, given input in and input error inerr, will always produce output out, output error outerr, a return code rc, and a new function f2 to execute next."

The tuple is signed by the ISM kernel, which is responsible for controlling function execution. The signature of the ISM kernel represents the *promise* of the kernel to guarantee the behavior specified by the tuple. This approach aligns with Promise Theory, where only the agent (in this case, the ISM kernel) can make promises.

## The Role of the ISM Kernel in State Transitions

The ISM kernel acts as the agent making promises about state transitions. It provides the runtime environment for functions (f1, f2, etc.) but retains control over their behavior. The kernel promises to execute functions according to the tuple it signs. 

This separation ensures that individual functions (f1, f2, etc.) cannot make promises about their own behavior or the behavior of the system. Allowing functions to make promises would violate Promise Theory, as only the kernel (the controlling agent) can guarantee outcomes related to state transitions.

Thus, the kernel provides the necessary control over function execution, ensuring that the system adheres to the promised behavior while maintaining compatibility with Promise Theory. Functions themselves remain passive entities that the kernel manages, preventing them from making claims about system behavior or state transitions.

## Discussion and Conclusion

We have postulated that a decentralized infinite state machine, where each agent manages its local state and interacts with other agents through promises about future state transitions, is compatible with Semantic Spacetime (SST) and Promise Theory (PT). This model aligns with the decentralized, autonomous nature of agents in SST and the promise-based interaction model of PT.

To facilitate implementation, we proposed a generic tuple-based language for describing state transitions in ISM. The tuple formalizes the promise made by the ISM kernel about the execution of functions and their resulting outputs and transitions. Importantly, the kernel—acting as the agent—controls function execution, while functions themselves cannot make promises about behavior, preserving the core principles of Promise Theory.

This framework provides a promising foundation for designing decentralized systems that operate autonomously and scalably, with clear responsibilities for state transitions managed by the ISM kernel. Future work can focus on expanding this model to real-world distributed systems and exploring the performance and resilience of ISM-based architectures.
