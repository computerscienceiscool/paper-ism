openscad graph: add nodes

Add nodes to make a total of 30 nodes.  Adjust the X and Y node
positions to random, non-monotonic values between 0 and 100.  Adjust
the Z node positions to be more random while still monotonically
increasing from 0 to 200.

Add edges to the graph.  Make each node have between 2 to 4 edges
connecting it to other nodes.
