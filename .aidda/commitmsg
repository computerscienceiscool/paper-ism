openscad graph: add a time arrow

Add a time arrow off to the side of the graph.  This is a cylinder
with a cone at the end of it.  The cylinder is N units long and 1 unit
in diameter.  The cone is N/10 units long and N/15 units in diameter
at the base.  The cone is at the +Z end of the cylinder.  The cylinder
and cone are colored black.  

The time arrow length N is determined by the maximum Z coordinate of
all the nodes in the graph.  

The time arrow is placed off to the side of the graph so that it does
not interfere with the graph itself.  This is done by keeping all of
the node coordinates in the graph as positive numbers and placing the
time arrow base at [-5, -5, 0].
