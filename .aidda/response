# A Decentralized Infinite State Machine and Promise-Based State Transition System Compatible with Smart Spacetime and Promise Theory

## Abstract

This paper introduces the concept of a decentralized infinite state machine (ISM) in which each agent manages its local state and interacts with other agents by making promises about future state transitions. We postulate that this ISM framework is compatible with both Promise Theory (PT) and Smart Spacetime (SST), providing a natural model for distributed systems where the interaction between autonomous agents defines system behavior. We integrate summaries of Mark Burgess's definitions of Promise Theory and Smart Spacetime to establish foundational understanding. Additionally, we propose a generic language for describing state transitions in ISM that aligns with SST and PT principles. This language relies on the concept of promises, where the ISM kernel (the agent) signs tuples that define guaranteed transitions between functions without those functions making promises themselves. We argue that this model maintains the separation of concerns between the kernel and the function execution, consistent with Promise Theory.

## Introduction

Distributed systems face challenges in managing state and coordinating behavior across multiple autonomous agents. A decentralized infinite state machine (ISM) framework offers a solution where each agent independently manages its local state and interacts with others through promises. These promises form a graph of state transitions, creating a decentralized model of computation.

**Promise Theory (PT)**, introduced by Mark Burgess, provides a formalism for describing the commitments that autonomous agents make to one another in a distributed environment. In PT, agents are considered autonomous and make promises about their behavior without external enforcement. This autonomy ensures that agents can adapt and respond to local conditions, promoting resilience and scalability in distributed systems.

**Smart Spacetime (SST)** is another concept developed by Mark Burgess, focusing on the interconnection of information systems and the physical world through promises. SST posits that systems—whether physical, social, or digital—can be understood as networks of autonomous agents making promises to each other. These promises define behaviors and relationships, creating a spacetime framework where interactions unfold over time.

This paper explores the relationship between ISM, PT, and SST, and introduces a generic language for describing state transitions in a way that aligns with these theories. By integrating the principles of Promise Theory and Smart Spacetime, we aim to develop a cohesive framework for decentralized computation in distributed systems.

## Promise Theory

Promise Theory is a mathematical model that describes how autonomous agents cooperate through the making and keeping of promises. In PT, a promise is a declaration by an agent about its future behavior, which other agents may rely upon. Key principles of Promise Theory include:

1. **Autonomous Agents**: Each agent controls its own behavior and makes decisions based on local information and its own understanding of the environment.

2. **Promises as Commitments**: Agents communicate their intended behaviors through promises, rather than commands or obligations imposed by others.

3. **Decentralized Interaction**: There is no central authority; coordination emerges from the voluntary cooperation of agents.

4. **Trust and Verification**: Agents may choose to trust the promises of others, but verification mechanisms can be used to assess whether promises are kept.

By framing system interactions in terms of promises, PT facilitates the design of systems that are robust, adaptable, and scalable. It shifts the focus from enforcement to cooperation, emphasizing the importance of local decision-making and the voluntary nature of agent interactions.

## Smart Spacetime

Smart Spacetime extends the principles of Promise Theory to encompass both informational and physical dimensions. In SST, the arrangement of agents in space and the sequence of their interactions over time are crucial to understanding system behavior. Key themes in Smart Spacetime include:

1. **Agents in Spacetime**: Agents are situated in a physical or logical space, and their positions and proximities affect their interactions.

2. **Temporal Dynamics**: The timing and order of interactions influence the evolution of the system.

3. **Local Interactions**: Agents interact primarily with their immediate neighbors, relying on local information rather than global state.

4. **Emergent Behavior**: System-level behaviors emerge from the aggregate of local interactions among agents.

Smart Spacetime emphasizes that space (the arrangement and connectivity of agents) and time (the sequencing of interactions) are fundamental to the operation of distributed systems. By understanding these dimensions, we can better predict and influence the behavior of complex systems.

## Decentralized Infinite State Machine (ISM)

An **infinite state machine** describes a system where the number of potential states is unbounded. In a decentralized ISM, each agent within the system maintains its local state and interacts with other agents by making promises about future transitions in a state graph.

In an ISM, agents decide their own next state based on internal conditions and the promises made by other agents. These agents are autonomous, following the core principle of Promise Theory. Agents only promise *what they will do next*, and these promises inform others' decisions about their own state transitions.

The *decentralized* aspect ensures that there is no central controller, and each agent acts independently, promoting scalability and fault tolerance. This aligns with the SST focus on local interactions and the significance of spatial relationships among agents.

## Compatibility between ISM, Promise Theory, and Smart Spacetime

The ISM framework is inherently compatible with both Promise Theory and Smart Spacetime:

- **Promise Theory Compatibility**: In ISM, agents make promises about their future state transitions, adhering to the principles of autonomy and voluntary cooperation. The ISM kernel (acting as the agent) promises the execution of functions according to specified transitions, without imposing behavior on other agents.

- **Smart Spacetime Compatibility**: ISM agents operate within a spacetime context, where their interactions and state transitions unfold over time and are influenced by their spatial relationships. The decentralized nature of ISM emphasizes local interactions, mirroring SST's focus on the significance of space and time in system behavior.

By integrating the concepts of PT and SST into ISM, we create a robust framework for modeling distributed systems that leverages the strengths of autonomous agents making promises within a spacetime context.

## A Generic Language for State Transitions

To enable ISM compatibility with Promise Theory and Smart Spacetime, we propose a generic language for describing state transitions. This language uses a tuple format to capture promises about function execution. The proposed format is as follows:

```
(f1, in, inerr, out, outerr, rc, f2)
```

Where:  
- **f1**: The function currently being executed.  
- **in**: Input to the function.  
- **inerr**: Any input error that the function needs to handle.  
- **out**: The expected output of the function.  
- **outerr**: Any output errors generated by the function.  
- **rc**: Return code indicating the result of the function (e.g., success or failure).  
- **f2**: The next function that will be executed in the state graph.

This tuple asserts (or promises) that "function f1, given input in and input error inerr, will always produce output out, output error outerr, a return code rc, and a new function f2 to execute next."

The tuple is signed by the ISM kernel, which is responsible for controlling function execution. The signature of the ISM kernel represents the *promise* of the kernel to guarantee the behavior specified by the tuple. This approach aligns with Promise Theory, where only the agent (in this case, the ISM kernel) can make promises.

## The Role of the ISM Kernel in State Transitions

The ISM kernel acts as the agent making promises about state transitions. It provides the runtime environment for functions (f1, f2, etc.) but retains control over their behavior. The kernel promises to execute functions according to the tuple it signs.

This separation ensures that individual functions (f1, f2, etc.) cannot make promises about their own behavior or the behavior of the system. Allowing functions to make promises would violate Promise Theory, as only the kernel (the controlling agent) can guarantee outcomes related to state transitions.

Thus, the kernel provides the necessary control over function execution, ensuring that the system adheres to the promised behavior while maintaining compatibility with Promise Theory. Functions themselves remain passive entities that the kernel manages, preventing them from making claims about system behavior or state transitions.

## Discussion and Conclusion

We have integrated summaries of Mark Burgess's definitions of Promise Theory and Smart Spacetime to establish a foundational understanding of these concepts. We have postulated that a decentralized infinite state machine, where each agent manages its local state and interacts with other agents through promises about future state transitions, is compatible with both PT and SST. This model aligns with the decentralized, autonomous nature of agents in PT and the spacetime framework of SST.

To facilitate implementation, we proposed a generic tuple-based language for describing state transitions in ISM. The tuple formalizes the promise made by the ISM kernel about the execution of functions and their resulting outputs and transitions. Importantly, the kernel—acting as the agent—controls function execution, while functions themselves cannot make promises about behavior, preserving the core principles of Promise Theory.

This framework provides a promising foundation for designing decentralized systems that operate autonomously and scalably, with clear responsibilities for state transitions managed by the ISM kernel. Future work can focus on applying this model to real-world distributed systems and exploring the performance and resilience of ISM-based architectures.
