# A Decentralized Infinite State Machine and Promise-Based State Transition System Compatible with Semantic Spacetime and Promise Theory

## Abstract

This paper introduces the concept of a decentralized infinite state machine (ISM) in which each agent manages its local state and interacts with other agents by making promises about future state transitions. We postulate that this ISM framework is compatible with both Semantic Spacetime (SST) and Promise Theory (PT), providing a natural model for distributed systems where the interaction between autonomous agents defines system behavior. Additionally, we propose a generic language for describing state transitions in ISM that aligns with SST and PT principles. This language relies on the concept of promises, where the ISM kernel (the agent) signs tuples that define guaranteed transitions between functions without those functions making promises themselves. We argue that this model maintains the separation of concerns between the kernel and the function execution, consistent with Promise Theory.

## Introduction

Distributed systems face challenges in managing state and coordinating behavior across multiple autonomous agents. A decentralized infinite state machine (ISM) framework offers a solution where each agent independently manages its local state and interacts with others through promises. These promises form a graph of state transitions, creating a decentralized model of computation.

Semantic Spacetime (SST), as introduced by Mark Burgess, offers a way to understand distributed systems as interacting agents that operate based on local knowledge and autonomy. SST emphasizes that interactions across space (the arrangement of agents) and time (the order of interactions) are intrinsic to understanding system behavior. Promise Theory (PT) provides a formalism for describing the commitments agents make to each other in a distributed environment. PT posits that systems function through promises, where autonomous agents declare their intentions and capabilities, and other agents react accordingly.

By integrating SST and PT, we hypothesize that ISM can be understood within this framework, allowing us to develop a cohesive model for decentralized computation where the system behavior emerges from local interactions and promises made by autonomous agents.

This paper explores the relationship between ISM, SST, and PT, and introduces a generic language for describing state transitions in a way that aligns with these theories.

## Promise Theory

Promise Theory, introduced by Mark Burgess, is a model for understanding cooperative behavior in networks of autonomous agents. Key concepts include:

1. **Autonomous Agents**: Each agent operates independently, making local decisions based on its own understanding of the environment and the promises made by others. There is no central control dictating agent behavior.
   
2. **Promises as Commitments**: Agents interact through promises, which are declarations of intent regarding future behavior. Promises define what an agent commits to providing or expecting, enabling coordination without direct commands.
   
3. **Local Decision-Making**: Emphasizes that agents base their actions on local information, enhancing system resilience and adaptability. Agents are responsible for managing their own behavior and promises.

Promise Theory provides a framework for analyzing and designing distributed systems by focusing on cooperation through promises rather than enforced obligations. This approach allows for scalable, flexible, and robust systems where global behavior emerges from local interactions.

## Semantic Spacetime

Semantic Spacetime (SST) is a conceptual framework proposed by Mark Burgess that unifies space and time in understanding system behaviors. Key aspects include:

1. **Integration of Space and Time**: SST considers both spatial relationships (the arrangement and proximity of agents) and temporal dynamics (the timing and ordering of interactions) as fundamental to system behavior.
   
2. **Emergent Behavior**: System properties emerge from the cumulative effect of local interactions over spacetime, rather than being dictated by a central authority.
   
3. **Decentralized Management**: Supports scalability and adaptability by enabling agents to make decisions based on local spacetime contexts.

In SST, the focus is on how information and influence propagate through the network of agents. By modeling interactions within a spacetime framework, SST provides insights into the dynamics of distributed systems and the importance of context in agent behaviors.

## Decentralized Infinite State Machine (ISM)

An *infinite state machine* describes a system where the number of potential states is unbounded. Each agent within the system maintains its local state and interacts with other agents by making promises about future transitions in a state graph.

In an ISM:

- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Each agent determines its own next state based on internal conditions and the promises received from other agents. This aligns with Promise Theory's emphasis on autonomy.
- **Promise-Based Interactions**: Agents communicate by making promises about their behavior, forming a network of commitments that guide state transitions.
- **Decentralization**: There is no central controller; agents operate independently, which enhances scalability and fault tolerance.

The ISM leverages the principles of Promise Theory and operates within the context of Semantic Spacetime, where the interactions and state transitions of agents occur over spacetime dimensions.

## Semantic Spacetime and ISM Compatibility

Semantic Spacetime provides the foundational backdrop for the ISM framework:

- **Spatial Relationships**: Agents are positioned within a space where their proximity influences interactions. Promises made by nearby agents are more immediately relevant.
- **Temporal Dynamics**: State transitions occur over time, and the timing of promises affects system behavior.
- **Local Interactions**: Emphasizes that agents interact with their immediate environment, consistent with SST's focus on localism.

In the ISM, each agent's state transitions are influenced by the promises it makes and receives within its spacetime context. This creates a dynamic system where global behavior emerges from decentralized, local interactions, embodying the principles of both SST and Promise Theory.

## A Generic Language for State Transitions

To enable ISM compatibility with Promise Theory and Semantic Spacetime, we propose a generic language for describing state transitions. This language uses a tuple format to capture promises about function execution:

```
(f1, in, inerr, out, outerr, rc, f2)
```

Where:

- **f1**: The current function being executed.
- **in**: Input provided to the function.
- **inerr**: Any input errors that need to be handled.
- **out**: The expected output of the function.
- **outerr**: Any output errors generated by the function.
- **rc**: Return code indicating the result (e.g., success or failure).
- **f2**: The next function to execute in the state graph.

This tuple represents a promise made by the ISM kernel:

> *Given input `in` and input error `inerr`, function `f1` will produce output `out`, output error `outerr`, return code `rc`, and will transition to function `f2`.*

By signing this tuple, the ISM kernel commits to executing the state transition as promised. This adheres to Promise Theory by ensuring that only the agent (the ISM kernel) makes promises about behavior, maintaining a clear separation between the controller and the functions.

## The Role of the ISM Kernel in State Transitions

The ISM kernel acts as the agent responsible for:

- **Making Promises**: The kernel makes promises about state transitions by signing the tuples that define them.
- **Controlling Execution**: It manages the execution of functions, ensuring that the promised transitions occur as specified.
- **Maintaining Autonomy**: By controlling the promises and execution, the kernel preserves the autonomy of agents as per Promise Theory.

Functions (`f1`, `f2`, etc.) are passive; they do not make promises but are invoked according to the kernel's promises. This design:

- **Prevents Violations**: Ensures functions cannot independently make promises, which would violate the principles of Promise Theory.
- **Separates Concerns**: Distinguishes between the control logic (kernel) and the operational logic (functions), simplifying the system architecture.

## Discussion and Conclusion

We have proposed that a decentralized infinite state machine (ISM), where each agent manages its local state and interacts through promises, is compatible with both Semantic Spacetime (SST) and Promise Theory (PT). By integrating summaries of Mark Burgess's definitions:

- **Promise Theory**: We understand that autonomous agents interact by making promises, fostering cooperation without central control.
- **Semantic Spacetime**: We see that agent interactions over space and time lead to emergent system behaviors.

The ISM framework leverages these concepts by:

- **Utilizing Promises**: Agents make promises about state transitions, aligning with PT.
- **Operating in Spacetime**: Interactions and transitions occur within a spacetime context, as per SST.

The proposed generic language for state transitions formalizes promises made by the ISM kernel, ensuring that the system adheres to the principles of PT and SST. By keeping functions passive and centralizing promise-making in the kernel, we maintain a clear separation of concerns.

This framework lays the groundwork for designing decentralized systems that are scalable, adaptable, and resilient. Future work includes:

- **Implementing the ISM Framework**: Developing practical systems based on this model.
- **Exploring Performance**: Analyzing how the ISM performs in real-world scenarios.
- **Extending Theoretical Foundations**: Further integrating PT and SST into distributed system design.
