# Decentralized Infinite State Machine with Promise-Based State Transitions Compatible with Semantic Spacetime and Promise Theory

## Abstract

We present the decentralized infinite state machine (DISM), where each agent manages its local state and interacts with others by promising future state transitions. The DISM framework aligns with Semantic Spacetime (SST) and Promise Theory (PT), modeling decentralized systems where autonomous agent interactions define system behavior. We introduce a generic language for describing DISM state transitions that adhere to SST and PT principles. This language utilizes promises, with the DISM kernel (the agent) signing tuples that outline transitions between functions without the functions making promises themselves. This model maintains a clear separation between the kernel and hosted functions, consistent with Promise Theory.

## Definition of Terms

### State Machine

A **state machine** models a system's behavior as a sequence of states, transitioning based on inputs and internal conditions.

### Finite State Machine (FSM)

A **finite state machine** has a fixed number of states and transitions, suitable for systems with limited states. For example, a traffic light cycles through red, yellow, and green states based on timers and sensor inputs. FSMs form cyclic directed graphs with states as nodes and transitions as edges.

### Infinite State Machine (ISM)

An **infinite state machine (ISM)** allows an unbounded number of states. A git repository exemplifies an ISM, with each commit representing a unique state. General-purpose computing systems also function as ISMs, advancing states through program executions. Although physical computers have finite states, their state space is effectively unbounded. ISMs typically form open-ended directed graphs without repeating states.

### Decentralized State Machine (DSM)

A **decentralized state machine (DSM)** consists of interconnected state machines operating autonomously without a central controller. Each machine manages its local state based on inputs from local sources or other state machines. DSM behavior forms a hypergraph, remaining open-ended if it includes an ISM.

### Decentralized Finite State Machine (DFSM)

A **decentralized finite state machine (DFSM)** example is the flag transfer method for directing traffic at construction sites. Each flagger follows fixed signaling rules and communicates via a token or flag carried by the last car in a group.

### Decentralized Infinite State Machine (DISM)

A **decentralized infinite state machine (DISM)** example includes a group of git repository forks, where each repository acts as an ISM interacting through pull and push operations.

### Transition Function

A **transition function** maps the current state to the next state. In FSMs, it uses a static transition table. In ISMs, it uses a dynamic table that returns both the next state and the subsequent state table. For example, a computing system’s transition function reads and writes disk states.

### Agent

An **agent** is an autonomous entity, such as a person, program, machine, or subatomic particle. Agents can influence and be influenced by their environment.

### Pure Functions and Side Effects

A **pure function** has no side effects and returns the same output for the same input. Decentralized systems require side effects through agent communications, altering the system’s total state.

### Promise Theory

**Promise Theory (PT)**, introduced by Mark Burgess, models autonomous agent interactions in decentralized environments. Agents promise their behavior to others, emphasizing voluntary commitments without imposing obligations or making promises on others. Promises reflect agents' assertions about their behavior, which observers interpret as fulfilled, broken, or pending based on their perspective. Trust builds as agents observe promise fulfillment.

### Semantic Spacetime

**Semantic Spacetime (SST)**, developed by Mark Burgess, extends PT into physics and cosmology, integrating space and time dimensions into system interaction models. Agents interact within a spacetime fabric, where spatial arrangement and interaction sequence are crucial. SST applies to any interacting system, including subatomic particles, and supports branching or parallel timelines. SST and PT reveal that all systems rely on explicit and implicit promises for organization and governance.

## Semantic Spacetime and DISM Compatibility

Integrating PT and SST into the DISM framework forms a cohesive model for decentralized computation. Agents operate autonomously, interact locally, and contribute to emergent system behavior. The system’s health depends on agents' promises, and developers act as agents, promising system behaviors through governance algorithms. This paper explores ISM, PT, SST relationships and introduces a language for state transitions aligned with these theories. Promises represent factual assertions at specific timeline points with truth values: true, false, or undecided.

## Decentralized Infinite State Machine (ISM)

DISM operates without a central controller, promoting scalability and fault tolerance. Each agent determines its next state based on internal conditions and other agents' promises, following PT principles of autonomy. Agents manage their behavior independently and observe others' promises to guide their state transitions.

## Promise Theory

Promise Theory models autonomous agent behavior in decentralized systems through voluntary commitments:
- **Agents are Autonomous:** Each agent controls its behavior without external compulsion.
- **Local Decision-Making:** Agents use local information and received promises to make decisions.
- **Trust and Verification:** Agents build trust by observing promise fulfillment.

Applying PT to ISM ensures agents interact through voluntary commitments, enhancing system resilience and adaptability. Agents promise state transitions, informing others’ decisions.

## Semantic Spacetime

Semantic Spacetime incorporates space and time into system interaction semantics:
- **Agents:** Autonomous entities interacting with the environment and each other.
- **Space:** Arrangement and relationships between agents affect interactions and information flow.
- **Time:** Sequence and timing of interactions influence event causality and synchronization.
- **Local Interactions:** System behavior emerges from local interactions.
- **Emergent Behavior:** Complex behaviors arise from simple agent interactions over spacetime.

In ISM, SST contextualizes agents' promises and state transitions over time and network, aiding in modeling and predicting decentralized system behavior.

## Semantic Spacetime and ISM Compatibility

SST provides a framework for understanding decentralized systems with autonomous agents operating in space and time. In ISM, SST contextualizes agents' promises about state transitions within their spacetime environment. Agents' state transitions reflect local interactions, aligning system behavior with SST principles.

## A Generic Language for State Transitions

We propose a generic language for DISM state transitions using tuples to capture promises about function execution:

`(f1, invars, outvars, f2)`

Where:
1. **f1 (Current Algorithm/State):**
   - Represents the current algorithm or function the agent executes.
   - Serves as the processing starting point, encapsulating logic and internal state.

2. **invars (Input Variables):**
   - Inputs provided to **f1**, which can be simple or complex structures.
   - Influence **f1**'s operation, leading to state changes.

3. **outvars (Output Variables):**
   - Outputs produced by **f1** after processing **invars**.
   - Used by other agents or for further processing.

4. **f2 (Next Algorithm/State):**
   - The next algorithm or function the agent executes.
   - Reflects any internal changes from processing, updating the agent's state.

### How the Model Works

- **State Transition Process:**
  1. The agent processes **invars** using **f1**.
  2. **f1** produces **outvars** as results.
  3. Internal changes during processing update the state to **f2**.
  4. The agent transitions to **f2**, incorporating any modifications.

### Key Characteristics

- **Algorithms as Stateful Entities:** **f1** and **f2** represent the agent's processing logic and state.
- **Emphasis on State Transitions:** Focus on state evolution over time.
- **Internal Side Effects:** Processing may change the state, leading to **f2**.
- **Deterministic Promises:** The agent promises to produce **outvars** and transition to **f2** based on **invars**.

### Relation to Promise Theory and Semantic Spacetime

- **Promise Theory (PT):**
  - **Autonomy and Local Control:** Agents manage state transitions independently.
  - **Promises as Commitments:** Agents commit to processing inputs into outputs without external control.

- **Semantic Spacetime (SST):**
  - **Spacetime Framework:** Maps temporal evolution and spatial arrangement.
  - **Interacting Agents:** Agents influence each other’s states over time.

### Benefits of the Model

1. **Modularity:** Encapsulates processing logic and state within agents.
2. **Scalability:** Decentralized state management avoids centralized bottlenecks.
3. **Adaptability:** Agents evolve dynamically through state transitions.
4. **Transparency:** Clear representation of inputs, outputs, and state changes.

### Practical Applications

- **Version Control Systems (e.g., Git):**
  - **f1:** Current commit hash.
  - **invars:** Changes to apply.
  - **outvars:** Minimal or empty; focus on state transition.
  - **f2:** New commit hash after changes.

- **Data Processing Pipelines:**
  - **f1:** Current data transformation function.
  - **invars:** Input data stream.
  - **outvars:** Transformed data.
  - **f2:** Updated function if transformation logic changes.

- **Distributed Systems:**
  - **f1:** Current node or service state.
  - **invars:** Messages or requests.
  - **outvars:** Responses or actions.
  - **f2:** New state after processing.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - **f1:** Current model parameters.
  - **invars:** Training data batch.
  - **outvars:** Updated performance metrics.
  - **f2:** Model with new parameters after training.

## The Role of the DISM Kernel in State Transitions

The DISM kernel signs the tuple instead of **f1**. Acting as the agent, the kernel manages state transitions, providing the runtime for functions. Functions are components of the kernel, not independent agents, allowing the kernel to influence their behavior.

## Suggested Encoding

To encode promises within the DISM framework, we recommend the following standards:

### CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation)

**CBOR** is a binary data serialization format ideal for encoding structured data like promises due to its compactness and flexibility.

- **Advantages:**
  - **Efficiency:** Reduces data size, beneficial for bandwidth-limited distributed systems.
  - **Flexibility:** Supports various data types, including nested structures.
  - **Interoperability:** Compatible with multiple programming languages and platforms.

- **Usage in DISM:**
  - Encode promise tuples `(f1, invars, outvars, f2)` using CBOR for efficient transmission and storage.
  - Enable quick parsing and validation by agents.

### COSE (CBOR Object Signing and Encryption)

**COSE** extends CBOR with signing and encryption, ensuring promise integrity and confidentiality.

- **Advantages:**
  - **Security:** Provides cryptographic signing to verify promise authenticity.
  - **Encryption:** Protects sensitive information within promises.
  - **Standardization:** Promotes interoperability through established standards.

- **Usage in DISM:**
  - Sign promise tuples with COSE to ensure they originate from trusted agents.
  - Encrypt promises when protecting confidential state transitions or sensitive interactions.

### CWT (CBOR Web Token)

**CWT** uses CBOR and COSE to create secure tokens for carrying claims (promises) compactly and verifiably, similar to JWT but optimized for space and efficiency.

- **Advantages:**
  - **Compactness:** Suitable for bandwidth and storage-constrained environments.
  - **Security:** Inherits COSE's signing and encryption.
  - **Extensibility:** Supports custom claims relevant to DISM.

- **Usage in DISM:**
  - Represent promises as CWTs to encapsulate claims within secure tokens.
  - Allow agents to verify promises without exposing underlying data unnecessarily.

### Integration Considerations

- **Schema Definition:** Establish a clear schema for promises within CBOR, COSE, and CWT to ensure agent consistency.
  
- **Versioning:** Control encoding schema versions to manage updates and maintain DISM framework compatibility.
  
- **Performance Optimization:** Benchmark encoding and decoding to meet decentralized system performance requirements.
